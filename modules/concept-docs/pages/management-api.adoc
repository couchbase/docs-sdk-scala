{description}


The Couchbase {name-sdk} has a management API to provision clusters.
This is not the only programmatic way to deploy Couchbase, and you may wish to look at
xref:cloud:terraform:index.adoc[Terraform] for Capella, or some of our command line tools.

// ...
Management operations in the Scala SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `buckets()` call on the cluster:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "user", "123456");
BucketManager manager = cluster.buckets();
manager.createBucket(bucketSettings);
----

// The `BucketSettings` can be created via a builder, [.api]`DefaultBucketSettings.builder()`.
This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.getBucket(string)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.updateBucket(bucketSettings)`).

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
////





// Collections & Scopes
////

The Collections feature in Couchbase Server 7.0 is fully implemented in the Scala SDK version 1.2.

Please see the xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections page] in the Server docs.

== Using Collections & Scopes

Access a non-default collection, in the default scope, with:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$CollectionsExample.scala[tag=collections_1,indent=0]
----

And for a non-default scope:
[source,scala]
----
include::example$CollectionsExample.scala[tag=collections_2,indent=0]
----


== Further Reading

To see Collections in action, take a look at our xref:howtos:working-with-collections.adoc[Collections-enabled Travel Sample page].

== User Management
// include::{version-common}@sdk:pages:partial$user-management.adoc[]


The SDK lets you programmatically create _users_, assign them _roles_ and associated _privileges_, and remove them from the system.

This is an overview of the user management API's capabilities.
// For a practical look at using it, see xref:howtos:sdk-user-management-example.adoc[Sample Code].

=== Creating a User

The syntax required for creating a user varies according to language, and is covered for each SDK in the management documentation.
The basic form is as follows:

----
boolean upsertUser (String userid, UserSettings settings)
----

The method *upsertUser* creates a user and adds the user to the Couchbase Cluster.
The user will subsequently be visible in the *Security* panel of the Couchbase Web Console.
Note that successful user-addition results in a user _locally_ defined, with _username_ and _password_ stored on Couchbase Server: _external_ users (whose credentials reside on a network-available server, possibly accessed by means of LDAP) should not be created by this SDK method.
If the local user created by *upsertUser* already exists, the previous definition is overwritten.

The method takes two arguments.
The first, a _String_ is the user ID of the user to be created: for example, `johnsmith0325`, or `user734`.
This must be specified.

The second is a _UserSettings_ object.
This takes the following form:

----
UserSettings {
    String password;
    String name;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The object contains three data-members.
The first is a _String_ that specifies the user's password: this must be provided.
The second is a _String_ that specifies the user's name (for example, `John Smith`): this is optional, and so may be omitted.
The third is an array of _Role_ objects: this must be specified.
Each _Role_ object takes the following form:

----
Role {
    String role;
    String bucket_name;
}
----

The object's two data-members are both _Strings_, and must both be specified.
The _String_ specified as the role must correspond to a role supported by Couchbase Server.
The _String_ specified as the bucket_name must either correspond to a bucket currently defined on Couchbase Server; or be the asterisk character (_*_), meaning _all buckets_.

The method returns a _boolean_, which is `true` if the operation is successful, otherwise `false`.
// end::creating_a_user[]

[#listing_users]
// tag::listing_users[]
=== Listing Users

The basic form of the method used to return currently defined users is as follows:

----
List<User> getUsers()
----

The method returns a list of _User_ objects, each of which takes the following form:

----
User {
    String name;
    String id;
    String domain;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The name is the full name of the user.
The id is the user's ID.
The domain is either `local` or `external`.
Each Role object in the Role-array has the form already described above, in _Creating a User_.


=== Getting a User

The basic form of the method used to return an already defined user is as follows:

----
User getUser (String userid)
----

The method returns a _User_ object, which takes the following form:

----
User {
    String name;
    String id;
    String domain;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The name is the full name of the user.
The id is the user's ID.
The domain is either `local` or `external`.
Each Role object in the Role-array has the form described above, in _Creating a User_.


=== Removing a User

The basic form of the method used to remove users is as follows:

----
boolean removeUser (String userid)
----

The method's sole argument is the id of the user to be removed from the system, specified as a _String_.
The method returns a _boolean_, whose value is `true` if the operation is successful, otherwise `false`.
