You want to query your data, but does that always mean a {sqlpp} query to the Data Service?
The CRUD API of the {sqlpp} Query service is mirrored by the Data Service's API, but without the need for indexes, and using a binary protocol gives faster access than streaming JSON from the Query Service.


[source,scala]
----
collection.remove("document-key2", durability = Durability.Majority) match {
  case Success(result) => println("Document removed successfully")
  // The mutation is available in-memory on at least a majority of replicas
  case Failure(err: DocumentNotFoundException) =>
    println("The document does not exist")
  case Failure(err) => println("Error: " + err)
}
----

At its heart, a database is in the business of storing data and letting you query and retrieve it.
Putting a database on the network -- in particular a remote network, or another company's cloud service -- and partitioning the data across multiple nodes, with several replicas, does not alter this.
It does, however, mean that choices must be made to optimize for consistency or availability of data.

====
This page lays out some of the things you need to consider when designing an app.
If you have already reached your decisions, and want to work with the Data API, then skip straight to our pages on 
xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[], 
xref:howtos:subdocument-operations.adoc[], or

Whether you go through the Data Service, or Query,
you'll find that both follow the typical DML (Data Manipulation Language) patterns that you encounter in the relational database world.
See the xref:querying-your-data.adoc[SDK Query introduction] for choices of {sqlpp} queries for OLTP (transactional queries) and OLAP (analytics) -- 
including real-time analytics -- as well as fuzzy searches and vector search.

// earier doc intro:
Couchbase stores data in _documents_, and this is the atomic....

////

Designing an application to offer guarantees of durability or consistency in a networked environment is hard.
The newcomer to the area has to wrestle with concepts like https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/[CAP Theorum] and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)[many possible interpretations] of ACID transactions. 
Here we hope to keep it _relatively_ simple, with a look at which Couchbase features give you which guarantees,
when you may prefer to use them, and -- perhaps equally important, though sometimes overlooked -- 
what is the performance cost of these choices.



////
From 3.4 doc:

Data durability refers to the fault tolerance and persistence of data in the face of software or hardware failure. Even the most reliable software and hardware might fail at some point, and along with the failures, introduce a chance of data loss. Couchbase’s durability features include Synchronous Replication, and the possibility to use distributed, multi-document ACID transactions. It is the responsibility of the development team and the software architect to evaluate the best choice for each use case.
Couchbase’s distributed and scalable nature exposes any set-up to the risk of potential network and hardware problems. The key to durability is planning for resilience, by evaluating the options on offer for persistence and replication, and carefully considering the performance trade-offs involved.

Durability
Writes in Couchbase (from the SDK or elsewhere) are written to a single node. From there, Couchbase Server will take care of sending the mutation to any configured replicas, and to disk. By default all writes are asynchronous, but levels of durability can be set, to ensure replication and/or persistence to disks, before the write is committed.


//// 




== Data and Good Schema Design

Each level of durability guarantee carries a price in time to persist to replicas or to disk.
Transactional guarantees across multiple documents add another layer of performance cost -- something readily borne when the data is important enough, and justifiably discarded for many categories of transient and unimportant data.
However, many data fall into an intermediate category, and here the atomic consistency decision is made by what's tolerable for read and write times.
In this case, consider if a tweak to the schema, to bring items into the same document, can give you transactional guarntees without the performance penalty of multi-document transactions.

Consider, too, that many operations are performed at the _collection_ level, and keeping documents in the same collection can make for speedier indexing and queries -- whether {sqlpp} or Search.

The Server enforces no schema, enabing evolutionary changes to your data model that reflect changes in the real world.
The schema-on-read approach allows the client software that you write with the SDK to work with changes to an implicit schema,
and allows heterogeneous data.


=== Objects, Relations, Tables

In the Relational Database (RDBMS) world, a translaton layer is often used between the objects of your data model in your application,
and the tables that you store the data in.
JSON storage allows you to store complex types, like nested records and arrays, without decomposing them to a second table
(known in the SQL world as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization[database normalization^]).

When the relational model was proposed, more than 50 years ago, limitations in available computer resources meant that removing data duplication in one-to-many and many-to-many relationships this way made a great deal of sense.
There is still a case to be made for it for reducing inconsistencies -- the difference with a document database is that you get to choose when to do this.


=== Collections and Scopes

Couchbase's atomic units of data are documents, stored as key-value pairs.
The value can be anything, but storing in JSON format enables indexing, searching, and many useful ways of working with the data from the SDK.

Collections are arbitary groupings of the data documents.
Ones that suit your object model.
For example, one collection of students enrolled at the college
and one collection of courses available for them to take.
Notionally you may view them as equivalent to an RDBMS table -- but it's up to you.

Within a bucket, you can organize your collections into scopes -- some methods are available at the bucket level,
but Search and Query Services favour Scope-level indexing and querying for greater efficiency.

// Worth putting in?

// Change link once 3.3 is archived?

== Concurrent Document Mutations




=== Performance considerations

CAS operations incur no additional overhead.
CAS values are always returned from the server for each operation. 
Comparing CAS at the server involves a simple integer comparison which incurs no overhead.

=== CAS value format

The CAS value should be treated as an opaque object at the application level. 
No assumptions should be made with respect to how the value is changed (for example, it is wrong to assume that it is a simple counter value). 
In the SDK, the CAS is represented as a 64 bit integer for efficient copying but should otherwise be treated as an opaque 8 byte buffer.



== Pessimistic locking

Pessimistic locking is the default approach for many RDBMS.
With Couchbase, 

== Expiration

*TODO* MaxTTL







////
TTL

DOC-11679
 
Re: Information on maxTTL for collections is not accurate
The summary of "Document do not expire" is actually incorrect. After I did some testing, it turns out that documents *can* expire within collections and buckets that have maxTTL=0 if you set the document's expiration to a positive value.

Instead of talking about maxTTL in terms of documents expiring or not expiring, I believe we should discuss maxTTL's effect on a document's expiration setting: a non-zero value as sets a default expiration value for all documents contained in the bucket/collection (actually, I believe this is all newly-created documents . Setting maxTTL on a bucket or collection does not automatically change the expiration of existing documents, from what I have seen). It also sets the upper bound on a the expiration value you can set in a document directly. The actual expiration time is set by the document's expiration setting.

=== Further Reading





This section of the docs covers the Data Service -- Couchbase's key-value document store, the heart of the database -- from the client perspective.
It addresses:

* Schemas for semi-structured data.
* The sub-document API for retrieving and modifying only a portion of a document (saving network bandwidth and transmission time).
* Durability options.
* Field-Level Encryption.
* Storing non-JSON documents.
* & Concurrent Document Mutations.

=== Lowest Latency Streams

Streaming in a distributed system is complex, and thus we do not make our internal streams and changes feed directly available.

However, it is exposed through use of our xref:spark-connector::index.adoc[Spark] or xref:kafka-connector::index.adoc[Kafka] connectors, which give you a high level API to our low level primitives.


The source connector streams documents from Couchbase Server using the high-performance Database Change Protocol (DCP) and publishes the latest version of each document to a Kafka topic in near real-time.

The sink connector subscribes to Kafka topics and writes the messages to Couchbase Server.
