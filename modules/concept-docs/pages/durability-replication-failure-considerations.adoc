{description}
Prepare your app for the inevitable challenges of working in a distributed network environment.



Even the most reliable software and hardware might fail at some point, and along with the failures, introduce a chance of data loss.
Couchbase's durability features include Synchronous Replication, and the possibility to use distributed, multi-document ACID transactions.
It is the responsibility of the development team and the software architect to evaluate the best choice for each use case.

This page covers the durability options offered by Couchbase Server, 
with the rest of this section covering logging, health check, and observability --
all key to understanding the health of a complex, distributed environment.

=== Legacy Durability

Early versions of Couchbase Server used client-verified durablilty.
This is still available in the SDK --
see the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-scala-client/com/couchbase/client/scala/durability/index.html[API documentation on durability] for details of `PersistTo` and `ReplicateTo` --
but in almost every case with current Couchbase Server versions it's best to use the guarantees offered by the the Server.
