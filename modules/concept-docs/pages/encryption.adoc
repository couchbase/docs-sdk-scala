[abstract]
Fields within a document can be securely encrypted by the SDK, to support FIPS-140-2 compliance.


Client-side implementation of Field Level Encryption is available in the xref:2.7@java-sdk::encryption.adoc[previous (2.0 API) version of the other SDKs].
It will be enabled in a future release of the third generation SDK (Scala SDK 1.x).
