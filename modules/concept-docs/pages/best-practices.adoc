From batching and reactive APIs, to unit tests and handling errors.
There's plenty that can be done to remove bottlenecks in development and in performance, and this page can be your checklist of areas not to neglect as you develop your app.



== Security

But before worrying about bottlenecks, let's put security concerns first.

Security is a process, and not just a set of checkboxes -- but 
//

=== Roles and RBAC

Self-managed Couchbase Server uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which is reflected in our managed service as a nuanced set of Roles.
Data security depends in part on only giving access to 
// 



// concept snippet

// include::{version-common}@sdk:pages:partial$rbac.adoc[]

RBAC restrict resources on a Couchbase cluster to an identified user, allocated by role.

*TODO* update and add Capella here


==== Users, Resources, Roles, and Privileges

Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition uses _Role-Based Access Control_ for applications to restrict _resources_ on a Couchbase cluster to an identified _user_.

Each user who attempts resource-access is identified by means of the _credentials_ they pass to Couchbase Server, for purposes of _authentication_: these consist of a _username_ and (typically) a _password_.
Once the user is authenticated, an _authorization_ process checks the _roles_ with which the user is associated.
If one or more of these roles correspond to _privileges_ that permit the user-requested level of resource-access, access is duly granted; otherwise, it is denied.

Users who have been assigned the *Admin* role for the cluster are able to create, edit, and remove users.
The SDK provides APIs to support these activities.

NOTE: Introductory examples in the SDK documentation use the _Administrator_ user to ensure that developers can quickly get up and running; this _should not be used in production_.
Elsewhere we use a general "user" which represents whichever permission levels are appropriate to your application.


== Performance

Couchbase's Data Service uses a fast binary protocol, which will always outperform JSON streamed over HTTP from {sqlpp} queries.
If you know the key (ID) of a document, then use the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Data Service].

If you need pessimistic logging, in particular if you need to lock documents for multi-document ACID transactions, then anything you can do at the schema level to reduce the number of documents locked simultaneously wil remvoe a bottleneck to updating the affected documents.  



=== Dealing with Timeout Errors


// see also
// https://couchbasecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CST/pages/1993769712/Java+-+Debugging+KV+Timeouts
// in Support wiki


* `waitUntilReady` should be the default setting for `Cluster.connect` and `Cluster.bucket` in most cases, so that resources are fully loaded before the client proceeds with CRUD calls to the database.
* LAN-type connection of client and server is recommended in production, but WAN development is a reality pre-production.
Ensure that you're familiar with the 
xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[best timeout options for WAN environments],
or at least set a xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#wan-development[WAN development Configuration Profile].

=== Concurrency and Async APIs

// ....this paragraph different for each SDK.

Choosing between the blocking, asynchronous, and reactive APIs for the Scala SDK is partly bound up with how (and where) you want to handle exceptions.

* Synchronous operations are blocking, and return a Scala `Try` object.
This contains either the result or a _Throwable_ exception,
which can be pattern matched over (using `flatMap` in more complex cases).
* The asynchronous API returns Scala `Future`, representing the execution of an asynchronous task and the promise of a future result.
An `ExecutionContext` must be provided, to give a thread pool for handling whatever is returned.
* The reactive API is a more natural fit for network-aware, fault tolerant programs, 
and will provide full back pressure for streaming results from large {sqlpp} or Search queries.

See the xref:howtos:concurrent-async-apis.adoc[Async & Reactive APIs page] for further discussion and practical examples.



== Error Handling

Best practices for error handling in Scala depend somewhat upon your choice of API: 
blocking, asynchronous, or reactive, as covered in the xref:concurrent-async-apis.adoc[async and reactive API guide].
That guide also covers how errors are actually returned (e.g. via `Try`, `Future`, or `Mono`) and handled.
See also the xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc[error handling guide],
which covers specific errors, along with a broader look at error handling strategies.


== Testing

Integrate developing with the {name-sdk} into your accustomed test framework.

== General Approach to Scala Exceptions

 When the unexpected happens, take a step-by-step approach.

// until opentelemetry release for link below, could add note on API to expose own tracing features?
// include::{version-common}@sdk:shared:partial$errors.adoc[tag=rto]





// Missing APIs
// For anything that is not covered by the SDK, 
// for example
// a raw FTS query from the SDK...
// use the HTTP client: 

////
public class CouchbaseHttpClient
extends Object
A specialized HTTP client for making requests to Couchbase Server.
Get an instance by calling Cluster.httpClient().

Example usage:

 public static String getAutoFailoverSettings(Cluster cluster) {
   HttpResponse response = cluster.httpClient().get(
       HttpTarget.manager(),
       HttpPath.of("/settings/autoFailover"));

   if (!response.success()) {
     throw new RuntimeException(
         "Failed to get auto-failover settings. HTTP status code " +
             response.statusCode() + "; " + response.contentAsString());
   }

   return response.contentAsString();
 }

 public static void disableAutoFailover(Cluster cluster) {
   HttpResponse response = cluster.httpClient().post(
       HttpTarget.manager(),
       HttpPath.of("/settings/autoFailover"),
       HttpPostOptions.httpPostOptions()
           .body(HttpBody.form(Map.of("enabled", "false"))));

   if (!response.success()) {
     throw new RuntimeException(
         "Failed to disable auto-failover. HTTP status code " +
             response.statusCode() + "; " + response.contentAsString());
   }
 }

== Additional Information

SDKs are client to Couchbase Server -- whether Capella Database-As-A-Service, or self-managed -- and in some areas it would be wise to take a fully rounded approach.
Read up on security and performance considerations relevant to your use case.

All aspects of the Couchbase RBAC system are covered in the section xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
Specifically, for information on:

* Adding _Users_ and assigning _roles_, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].
* _Roles_ required for resource-access, and the privileges they entail, see xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].
* _Resources_ controlled by Couchbase RBAC, see xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/resources-under-access-control.adoc[Resources Under Access Control].
