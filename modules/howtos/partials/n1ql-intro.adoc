You can query for documents in Couchbase using the N1QL query language, a language based on SQL, but designed for structured and flexible JSON documents.

Our query service uses N1QL, which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's used any dialect of SQL.
<<Additional Resources>> for learning about N1QL are listed at the bottom of the page.
Before you get started you may wish to checkout the xref:6.5@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[N1QL intro page].

[TIP]
.N1QL Compared to Key-Value
====
N1QL is excellent for performing queries against multiple documents, but if you only need to access or mutate a single document and you know its unique ID, it will be
much more efficient to use the Key-Value API.  We strongly recommend using both APIs to create a flexible, performant application.
