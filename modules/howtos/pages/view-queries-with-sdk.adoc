== Querying Views
Once you have a view defined, it can be queried from the Scala SDK by using the `viewQuery` method on a Bucket instance.

Here is an example:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Views.scala[tag=basic,indent=0]
var result = bucket.ViewQuery<Type>("design-doc", "view-name", options =>
    options.WithLimit
----



[source,scala]
----
include::example$Views.scala[tag=byName,indent=0]
----
