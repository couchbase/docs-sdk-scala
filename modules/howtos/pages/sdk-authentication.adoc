[abstract]
As well as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Couchbase offers connection with Certificate Authentication, and works transparently with LDAP.


Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide covered the basics for authorizing against a Couchbase cluster, but you may need to use alternative authentication methods such as Certification.


== RBAC


Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide introduced basic authentication against a Couchbase cluster:

== Authenticating a Scala Client by Certificate

For sample procedures whereby certificates can be generated and deployed, see xref:6.5@server:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].
The rest of this document assumes that the processes there, or something similar, have been followed.
That is, a cluster certificate has been created and installed on the server, a client certificate has been created, and it is stored in a JVM keystore along with the cluster's certificate.

== LDAP

If you are on a network where access is controlled by LDAP, the SDK will work transparently with it.
No special configuration is needed.
