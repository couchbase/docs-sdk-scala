= Request Tracing
:page-status: Developer Preview
:page-topic-type: howto

Collecting information about an individual request and its response is an essential feature of every observability stack. 

To give insight into a request/response flow, the SDK provides a `RequestTracer` interface and ships with both a default implementation as well as modules that can feed the traces to external systems (including OpenTelemetry).


== The Default ThresholdRequestTracer

By default, the SDK will emit information about requests that are over a configurable threshold every 10 seconds. 
Note that if no requests are over the threshold no event / log will be emitted.

It is possible to customize this behavior by modifying the configuration:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Tracing.scala[tag=tracing-configure,indent=0]
----

In this case the emit interval is one minute and Key/Value requests will only be considered if their latency is greater or equal than two seconds.

The JSON blob emitted looks similar to the following (prettified here for readability):

[source,json]
----
[
   {
      "top":[
         {
            "operation_name":"GetRequest",
            "server_us":2,
            "last_local_id":"E64FED2600000001/00000000EA6B514E",
            "last_local_address":"127.0.0.1:51807",
            "last_remote_address":"127.0.0.1:11210",
            "last_dispatch_us":2748,
            "last_operation_id":"0x9",
            "total_us":324653
         },
         {
            "operation_name":"GetRequest",
            "server_us":0,
            "last_local_id":"E64FED2600000001/00000000EA6B514E",
            "last_local_address":"127.0.0.1:51807",
            "last_remote_address":"127.0.0.1:11210",
            "last_dispatch_us":1916,
            "last_operation_id":"0x1b692",
            "total_us":2007
         }
      ],
      "service":"kv",
      "count":2
   }
]
----

For each service (e.g. Key/Value or Query) an entry exists in the outer JSON array. 
The top N (10 by default) slowest operations are collected and displayed, sorted by the total duration. 
This promotes quick visibility of the "worst offenders" and more efficient troubleshooting.

Please note that in future releases this format is planned to change for easier readability, 
so we do not provide any stability guarantees on the logging output format and it might change between minor versions.

A new, yet to be stabilized, format can be enabled by setting the `com.couchbase.thresholdRequestTracerNewOutputFormat` system property to `true`. 
More information will be provided as we get closer to stabilization.


== OpenTelemetry Integration
[.status]#Developer Preview#

The built-in tracer is great if you do not have a centralized monitoring system, but if you already plug into the OpenTelemetry ecosystem we want to make sure to provide first-class support.

=== OpenTelemetry Setup
There are many ways to configure OpenTelemetry.
The first thing to consider is where your application should send the OpenTelemetry spans.
They can be sent directly to a tracing tool like Zipkin or Jaegar.
But a popular choice is to instead send to the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/[OpenTelemetry collector], which can perform some span processing (such as batching) before sending on to your tracing tool.

This minimal OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file will simply log all spans to console, to sanity check that your application is outputting spans to the collector:
[source,yaml]
----
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:

exporters:
  logging:
    logLevel: debug

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [logging]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [logging]
----

Save this to a file `config.yaml` and run the collector with:

`otelcol --config config.yaml`

=== Application Setup
Include an additional dependency which provides the interoperability code:

[source,sbt]
----
libraryDependencies += "com.couchbase.client" % "tracing-opentelemetry" % "0.3.4"

libraryDependencies += "io.opentelemetry" % "opentelemetry-sdk" % "1.1.0"
libraryDependencies += "io.opentelemetry" % "opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin" % "1.1.0"
libraryDependencies += "io.opentelemetry" % "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp" % "1.1.0"
libraryDependencies += "io.grpc" % "grpc-netty" % "1.35.0"
----

Before starting, here are all imports used in the following examples:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Tracing.scala[tag=imports,indent=0]
----

Now, you can configure an OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider`.  We are using the OTLP GRPC exporter, which the OpenTelemetry Collector is configured to listen for:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Tracing.scala[tag=otel-configure,indent=0]
----

Once the OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider` is set up, it can be wrapped into a Couchbase `RequestTracer` and passed into the environment:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Tracing.scala[tag=otel-use,indent=0]
----

At this point, all spans will be sent into the OpenTelemetry collector.  Once you are performing operations, you should see the collector (if it's using the configuration above) outputting spans to console:
```
Span #510
    Trace ID       : 3a2e0be43ba961d0fa5220aa4e198a6c
    Parent ID      :
    ID             : 137a0adf88b8e798
    Name           : upsert
    Kind           : SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL
    Start time     : 2021-04-29 10:57:50.3517228 +0100 BST
    End time       : 2021-04-29 10:57:50.3531412 +0100 BST
    Status code    : STATUS_CODE_UNSET
    Status message :
Attributes:
     -> db.name: STRING(default)
     -> db.couchbase.service: STRING(kv)
     -> db.operation: STRING(upsert)
     -> db.system: STRING(couchbase)
     -> db.couchbase.collection: STRING(_default)
     -> db.couchbase.scope: STRING(_default)
```

=== Parent Spans
If you want to set a parent for an SDK request, you can do it in the respective `*Options` for any operation.
Just call `OpenTelemetryRequestSpan.wrap` to wrap your OpenTelemetry span into a Couchbase span:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$Tracing.scala[tag=otel-options,indent=0]
----


== OpenTracing Integration
[.status]#Developer Preview#

In addition to OpenTelemetry, we also provide support for OpenTracing for legacy systems which have not yet migrated to OpenTelemetry. 
Note that we still recommend migrating eventually since OpenTracing has been sunsetted.

You need to include the `tracing-opentracing` module:

[source,sbt]
----
libraryDependencies += "com.couchbase.client" % "tracing-opentracing" % "0.3.4"
----

And then wrap the OpenTracing `Tracer`:

[source,scala]
----
val tracer: RequestTracer = OpenTracingRequestTracer.wrap(tracer)

// Use the RequestTracer
val config: Try[ClusterEnvironment] = ClusterEnvironment.builder
  .requestTracer(tracer)
  .build
----

OpenTracing spans can be wrapped with `OpenTracingRequestSpan.wrap` and passed as parent spans to all SDK operations, in the same way as with OpenTelemetry.
