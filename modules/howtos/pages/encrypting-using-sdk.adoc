Client-side implementation of Field Level Encryption has not historically been a feature of the Couchbase Scala SDK,
but it is hoped to introduce it later this year.

Field Level Encryption _is_ available in most of the other SDKs,
including the xref:java-sdk:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc[Java SDK].
