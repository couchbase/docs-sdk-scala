The Field Level Encryption library enables encryption and decryption of JSON fields, to support FIPS-140-2 compliance.


Client-side implementation of Field Level Encryption is available in the previous versions of some of the other SDKs.
It will be enabled in a future release of the third generation SDK.

Field Level Encryption is available in the xref:3.0@java-sdk:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc[Java SDK], the xref:2.2@go-sdk:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc[Go SDK] and a _developer preview_ in the xref:3.1@dotnet-sdk:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc[.NET SDK].
