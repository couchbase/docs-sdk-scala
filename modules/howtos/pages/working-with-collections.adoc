The 3.0 API SDKs all work with Collections and Scopes.
As a practical demonstration, we have a collections-enabled version of the Travel Sample application.

The xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Collections feature] in Couchbase Server 7.0 is fully implemented in the
3.0 API versions of the Couchbase SDKs.

NOTE: When working with earlier versions (before the Developer Preview in 6.5), or with other server versions, the `defaultcollection` is used from the SDK.

See our xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample application] for more details.
