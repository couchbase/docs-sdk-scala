The xref:6.5@server:developer-preview:collections/collections-overview.adoc[Developer Preview of the upcoming Collections feature] in Couchbase Server is fully implemented in the 3.0 API versions of the Couchbase SDKs.
When working without the DP implemented, or with other server versions, the `defaultcollection` is used from the SDK.
