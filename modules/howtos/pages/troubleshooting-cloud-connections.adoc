// Additions to additional steps - scala-specific:

* The SDK logging should give some indication as to what's failing. 
  In particular, check if the DNS SRV lookup is successful. 
  It will look something like:
+
----
[ INFO] (cb-events) [com.couchbase.core][DnsSrvRecordsLoadedEvent][2086ms] Loaded seed hosts from DNS SRV: [cb-0000.<hostname>, cb-0001.<hostname>, cb-0002.<hostname>]
----
* You can determine if the certificate is the cause of the connection issues by *temporarily* disabling certificate validation with this alternative `ClusterEnvironment` configuration:
+
[source,scala]
----
    val env: ClusterEnvironment = ClusterEnvironment.builder
      .securityConfig(SecurityConfig()
        .trustManagerFactory(InsecureTrustManagerFactory.INSTANCE))
      .build
      .get
----
+
_This is not a secure connection._
_It is only suitable for debugging purposes, and *should not be used in production*._
