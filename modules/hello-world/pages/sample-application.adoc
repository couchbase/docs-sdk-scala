== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase {name-sdk} in action with Query and Search,
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the {name-sdk}.

The https://github.com/couchbaselabs/{travel-sample-git-project}/tree/HEAD/app[`app` directory] contains the various components, classes and functions for handling users, registration, and {sqlpp} (formerly N1QL) queries.

// TODO: we don't use the partial here, because of the location of swagger.json
// in try-cb-dotnet/wwwroot/
== REST API

You can explore the REST API here in read-only mode, or once you are running the application, at the `/apidocs` endpoint.
