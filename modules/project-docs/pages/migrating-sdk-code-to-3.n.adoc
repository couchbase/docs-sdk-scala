{description}

Couchbase Scala SDK 1.0 implements the Couchbase SDK 3.0 API.
It it the first release of the Couchbase Scala SDK, there are no releases implementing older APIs.
Migration will only be a concern if you are mixing code from different JVM SDKs in your application
-- specifically the Java SDK -- 
in which case you will need to be using Java SDK 3.0 and above. 
If you have programmed Couchbase client software against the Java 2.x SDK previously, 
then you may want to read the xref:3.0@java-sdk:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[Java migration guide].
