The Couchbase Scala SDK is a first class citizen in the https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-couchbase[Spring Data^] world, and the Scala SDK can leverage that through the JVM.

Couchbase also supports integrating with xref:2.4@spark-connector:ROOT:getting-started.adoc.adoc[Spark].

Why not take advantage of compatible Java tools? 
Many dataflow tools integrate with Couchbase, including https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-couchbase-bundle[Apache NiFi^], 
https://wildfly-extras.github.io/wildfly-camel/#_camel_couchbase[Apache Camel^],
and https://github.com/couchbaselabs/flink-connector-couchbase[Apache Flink^].

https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/couchbase.html[Databricks^] provides integration with the Couchbase Scala SDK and Spark.
